#**Since the project is not under active development I made this fork and merged the two PR available in the original repository (that includes a lot of fixes) and made a release.**

If your Android app is showing ads, but you would like to offer an option to remove them with a single in-app purchase, `Premiumer` is here to help!

First, add a dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
compile 'com.github.SandroMachado:premiumer:1.1.1'
```

And add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

There is no need to add any `aidl` files. Just ensure you call the appropriate lifecycle methods, for example like so:

```java
abstract class BaseActivity extends AppCompatActivity 
								implements PremiumerListener {

    private static final String SKU = "android.test.purchased";

    protected Premiumer mPremiumer;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Creates a new Premiumer instance.
        // There are a few other builder options available.
        mPremiumer = new Premiumer.Builder(this)
				        .sku(SKU)
				        .listener(this)
				        .build();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        // Binds the billing service, checks if 
        // ads should be shown and invokes either 
        // onShowAds() or onHideAds() on the registered listener.
        // If billing is unavailable, onBillingUnavailable() is 
        // invoked instead.
        mPremiumer.onStart();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        // Unbinds from the billing service.
        mPremiumer.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        // Stops listening for events and 
        // dismisses any pending requests.
        mPremiumer.onDestroy();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        // If you call Premiumer.purchase, then you must call
        // Premiumer.handleActivityResult.
        if (!mPremiumer.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        }
    }

}
```

With the above base class, extending it is equally easy. Check [the sample](https://github.com/tslamic/premiumer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/github/tslamic/premiumer/MainActivity.java). You will most likely want to use any of the remaining `Premiumer` methods:

- `requestSkuDetails()` which, unsurprisingly, requests the sku details
- `purchase(Activity)` which initiates the In-app Billing purchase
- `getPurchaseInfo()` which returns purchase related information
- `consumeSku()` which can consume the purchased sku

As you might have guessed, all `Premiumer` interaction results in a `PremiumerListener` callback. Here's the complete list:

| Method name   | Meaning      |
| ------------: |:-------------|
| `onShowAds()` | Invoked if the sku has not yet been purchased and ads should be visible. |
| `onHideAds()` | Invoked if the sku has been purchased and ads should not be visible. |
| `onBillingUnavailable()` | Invoked if In-app Billing is unavailable. |
| `onSkuDetails(SkuDetails)` | Invoked when `SkuDetails` information is ready. |
| `onSkuConsumed()` | Invoked when the sku has been successfully consumed. |
| `onFailedToConsumeSku()` | Invoked when the sku has not been successfully consumed. |
| `onPurchaseSuccessful(Purchase)` | Invoked on a successful sku purchase. |
| `onPurchaseBadResult(int, Intent)` | Invoked when the sku purchase is unsuccessful. |
| `onPurchaseBadResponse(Intent)` | Invoked when the sku purchase is unsuccessful. |
| `onPurchaseInvalidPayload(Purchase, String, String)`| Invoked when the sku purchase is successful, but the request payload differs from the purchase payload. |

If you feel that's too much, you can cherry pick the methods by extending `SimplePremiumerListener`.
